More in depth research shows that the numbers are this high not specifically due to female empowerment but due to the large number of informal jobs that are not regulated by the government and have very little to no pay for these women. So, while one might see these high rates as empowering, it’s important to note the quality and level of compensation from the kind of jobs women in these countries are able to contribute to as compared to the contributions in other countries in other regions like North America, Europe and Central Asia (Fetterolf).\n",

At first sight, it seems strange that one of the lowest GNI per capita regions in the world would have the largest Employment to population ratio. The answer is that most of the employment found in the “Jazz” region is different from other regions. An article explains that 66 percent of the employment in the region is from the informal sector, as revealed by the International Labour Organization (Mwita). \n",

The “Jazz” region has low metrics in health, economy, infrastructure, and employment. Even though “Jazz” is doing well in the environment metric, the reason is mainly because the “Jazz” region has one of the lowest GNI per capita.\n",
